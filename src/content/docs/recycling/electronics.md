Do you have an old phone, laptop, or keyboard to throw away? Well, if you do, don’t just toss it in the trash! Instead, look for the special green collection boxes listed on the [ElektroEko website](https://elektroeko.pl/punkty-zbierania-elektrosmieci/) near your place and drop them there. You’ll find these boxes all around Warsaw and in other cities across Poland.
