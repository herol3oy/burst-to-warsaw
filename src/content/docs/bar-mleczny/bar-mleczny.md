description: Unique milk bars – nostalgic, affordable, and delicious

Bar Mleczny (milk bar) is more than just a place to eat in Poland. It's a cultural institution. These old-style  restaurants are found not only in Warsaw but across the entire country. They offer simple, traditional Polish dishes that are both affordable and hearty. A Polish friend once told me that after placing his order, he always adds, "proszę wszystko połowa", or "na pół", which means “everything half.” Surprisingly, he often gets nearly the same portion as a full serving at half the price! This hack adds to the charm of the experience.
