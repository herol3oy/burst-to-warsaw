Description: Drinking alcoholic beverages by the Vistula River

It was quite a surprise the first time I saw people drinking alcohol in public by the river in Warsaw. [Along the Vistula River in Warsaw](https://um.warszawa.pl/-/alkohol-na-poniatowce-legalny), particularly across the Vistula boulevards and at [Poniatówka Beach](https://um.warszawa.pl/documents/39703/7003459/plaza_poniatowka_strefa_alkoholowa.pdf/9acd4c41-1889-987f-5f4a-4070dff57072?t=1634498828942), you can enjoy a drink outdoors. Although public drinking is generally prohibited in Poland, these areas are exceptions.

You’ll even see police officers strolling around while people sip wine or beer with friends. Still, I strongly recommend asking locals or the police to confirm you’re in a permitted zone. Better safe than sorry. Na zdrowie!
