[The Long Night of Museums](https://nocmuzeow.um.warszawa.pl/en/) (Noc Muze√≥w) is a brilliant initiative that dedicates one night each year to celebrating museums by inviting the public to visit them for free. The program also includes access to rarely open locations such as the Ministry of Education, which welcomes visitors only on this magical night.
