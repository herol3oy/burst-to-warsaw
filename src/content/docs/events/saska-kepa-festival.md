The [Saska Kępa Festival](https://promkultury.pl/?s=swieto+saskiej+kepy&post_type=event) is a fun annual event in the charming Saska Kępa district. Francuska Street is closed to turns into a lively space with concerts, food stalls, art shops, and a local bazaar.

It's a great time to enjoy with family and friends. I remember the first year I went, when T.Love was the main act. Just after their second or third song, a storm hit with heavy rain. They had to stop, and everyone ran for cover. Even with the rain, it was an unforgettable night.
