How to find opportunities to connect with people in Warsaw? I believe there are many ways. I'll tell you a few which worked for me!

## Couchsurfing
As a long-term member of [Couchsurfing](https://couchsurfing.com), I have to say that the journey was magnificent. I ran into so many people and was able to find many friends. Through this platform you can find weekly or monthly meetups or use the app to find people to hang out with.

## Postcrossing
[Postcrossing](https://postcrossing.com) is a next-level social website where you send and receive postcards. But they also occasionally have meetups that you can attend as a member of the website.
