I started this habbit quite late because but now I do and feel good. So thos bottles that have the word "Zwrotna" you can return them. In Biedronka and Å»abka, they will reduce the price of what you gonna buy and if you have the recipie, you'd be able to recived the deposit in cash. In Auchan you must have the recipie.
