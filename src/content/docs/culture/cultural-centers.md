description: Cultural centers in Warsaw have different events during the year

As a new arrival to the city even for a short visit or a life, you may consider to attend some cultural event. In Warsaw, we have different cultural centers in most of the districs where you can their programs for the current month (or even the year) and attend them. Notice that many of all these events are for free. One thing that I highly recommend is to sign up for the newsletters so if they have new program coming up, you'll get an email.
